### More About Strings
* Just like `" "` can wrap str's with single quotes, we can use escape characters to use single and double quotes inside of a single str
* `r"str"` can be used for strs that contain many backslashes as it evals them not as escape chars but as actual backslashes
* `"""str"""` | `'''str'''` can be used for multi-line strings
* Indexes, slices, and the `in` and `not in` operators all work with strings

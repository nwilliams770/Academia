    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    age = 2;
    age2 = age;
    age = 3;
    // age2 still equals 2, makes a copy, not referencing same space in memory
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    let team = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    team[3] = 'John'; // this will modify the original array!
    // team is just a reference to the original array, players

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    team = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    team = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    team = [...players]

    // spread will take every item out of your iterable and put it into the containing arrays

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    team = Array.from(players);

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;

    // we made a reference to person, not a copy!

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 12});
    //  can fold in new properties in the third argument.
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // there is a clone deep function to do deep level duplication

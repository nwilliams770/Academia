"You only have one chance to get it right...A good API needs to appeal tothe most powerful emotion: Laziness" - Joshua Bloch

So what are the characteristics of a good API:
- Easy to learn
- Intuitive / easy to use even without documentation
- Hard to misuse
- Easy to read and maintain code that uses it
- Sufficiently powerful to satisfy requirements/needs
- Easy to evolve (the simpler the initial API the easier it will be to extend)
- Appropriate to audience (make it beginner friendly)
- Opinionated (means people don't have to think)

Types of API:
### REST

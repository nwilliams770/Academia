## OOP and Prototypal Inheritance

- **Inheritance**: One object gets access to the properties and methods of another object. 

### Understanding the Prototype
- All objects (even functions) have a prototype property, which is just a reference to a proto object. 
dd
- A sequence of objects can be connected via it's prototype, creating the prototype chain. the JS engine will automatically search the chain for objects and methods
- **Reflection**: An object can look at itself, listening and changing its properties and methods.

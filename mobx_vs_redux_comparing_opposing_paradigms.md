## What are the tradeoffs between using MobX and Redux?
- Redux & Mobx:
    - Open-source client-side state management libs
    - Describe UI as a function of state
    - No relation to React although they play nice with it
- Redux, is like derivation of the Flux architecture:
    - Flux had a one-way dataflow:
        - Something occurs in the View, which propagates an action, action gets sent to store via callback that store registers to dispatcher, then store updates its state
    - Redux has 3 main differences:
        - As opposed to multiple stores, we have 1 store, one huge POJO 
        - No concept of dispatchers, uses pure functions
        - Store/state is immutable
- Mobx
    - observable values are essentially your state, Mobx wraps your data is observables which gives it observable capabilities, look at these like your spreadsheet cells
    - Then theres derivations:
        - Computed values, pure functions that derive state off your data, think of them as formulas in a spreadsheet, they produce new values
        - Reactions, similar to computed values but instead they create a side-effect, not a new value
- Comparing, we have (Redux | Mobx):
    - Single store / Domain class | Multi-store / Domain class
    - POJOs | Observable data
    - Immutable | Mutable
    - Normalized state | Nested state
    - Manually track updates | Automatically tracks updates
    - Explicit | Implicity
    - Passive | Reactive
    - Read-only state (prevState, action), Pure => newState | Read and write state => state, Impure
    - Actions required, must fire an action to know what to do to the state | Actions not required, observable data can accept data from anywhere, do not necessarily need actions
    - Normalize state, because immutable data, all ancestors of the state tree, even one's not being changed, need to be copied and updated as well, can cause Redux-connected UI components to re-render the UI even though concerned-with state didn't change | Keep state denormalized because you have computed values and tracked functions, so Mobx automatically keeps track of what you care about
- So what's the takeaway:
    - Mobx: more suited for a simpler application, rapid prototyping, small team, easier learning curve. Because it is reacting to state changes, good for real-time systems, dashboards, text editors, presentation software, NOT for event-based 
    - Redux: reacting to actions or events: business apps, event-based systems, game events involving a complex reaction
